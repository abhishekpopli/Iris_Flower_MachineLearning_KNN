# Iris_Flower_MachineLearning_KNN
My First ML Project, applying six classification system and analyzing their results. The most famous dataset of IRIS flower from UCI repository.
The dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers. There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimeters. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. All observed flowers belong to one of three species.
